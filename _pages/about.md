I am a Assistant Professor in ECE department with affiliate appointment with CSE department at UC San Diego. I lead [WCSNG](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu) Wireless Communication, Sensing and Networking Group at UC San Diego. 

My research vision is to design and prototype performant systems for sensing, computing, communicating and securing the information in our connected world. Throughout my career, my research has aimed to solve the fundamental and near-impossible problems, which has often lead to new areas of research and commercialization. My research group continues to work on same philosophy of solving fundamental problems, impacting areas of next generation communication, robotics, autonomous systems to every-day life [WCSNG](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu).

My group is highly inter-disciplinary spanning electrical engineers, data scientists, computer scientists and mechanical engineers and works at the intersection of signal processing, circuits, computer vision, machine learning and aritifical intelligence. We develop theory and algorithms with special focus on implementation and protyping of solutions in our impact areas. Our current impact areas include: wireless localization, sensing for autonomous driving, sensing for healthcare, spectrum sensing for next-generation networks, and wireless systems for VR/AR applications and created various open source datasets and tools that enables reproducible reserach and eases barrier to entry to the reserachers in communication and sensing. 

If you are a potential student, researcher or postdoc and interested in working with me or [my group](https://wcsng.ucsd.edu/publications), drop me an email (`dineshb at ucsd dot edu`) and/or reach out to the PhD students or postdocs.

Short Bio
----- 
I have been at UC San Diego as a faculty since January 2018. My group has diverse focus from computer vision, deep learning to wireless communication, sensing and networking. We build from theory to practice technologies which have impact on robotics, autonomous systems and day-to-day life. 

Previously, I worked as postdoctoral associate at MIT CSAIL, focusing on data-center networking and wireless sensing. I received my Ph.D. at Stanford University for my work on full-duplex radios, which were considered near impossible to build, basically enabling radios to transmit and receive simultaneously on the same frequency. From 2013 to 2015, I took a leave of absence from my Ph.D. to commercialize research on the practical full-duplex radio at Kumu Networks, which underwent successful field trials with tier 1 network providers worldwide – Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom and is now being commercially deployed. 

Before joining Stanford, I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in 2010. I was awarded a gold medal at IIT Kanpur for graduating at the top of the class of 2010 in Electrical Engineering. 


Broader Industry Impact 
-----

- Full Duplex 
Our research on full-duplex radios has translated into a commercial venture [Kumu Networks](http://www.kumunetworks.com). I worked as a Principal Scientist at Kumu Networks for nearly two years to commercialize this research and bring it to the rest of the world. 

At Kumu Networks, I led the technology (both architecture and algorithm design) for in-band full duplex radios to build a commercial product. The product completed successful field trials with major Tier 1 network providers -- [ Deutsche Telekom ](https://www.telekom.com/media/company/288612) and [SK Telecom](http://telecoms.com/423101/skt-and-kumu-show-off-full-duplex-5g-tech/) and is now being commercially deployed. To this date, it is the only successful commercial demonstration of full duplex radios. 

Due to its proven commercial viability and promise, full duplex is now actively being designed into next-generation wireless standards. Both 5G cellular and next-generation WiFi standards are incorporating full duplex or self-interference cancellation technology in various forms.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
