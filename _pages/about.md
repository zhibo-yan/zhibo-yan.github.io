I am currently working on Data center networking at Network Technology Laboratory, Huawei.
I received the Bachelor's in Communication Enginnering and the Ph.D. degree in Information and Communication Engineering, both from Nanjing University in 2017 and 2022. After graduation, I joined Huawei as a senior engineer.
